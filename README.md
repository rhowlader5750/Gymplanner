# Gymplanner

This project was my final project for my C++ course. My intention was to make an application that would allow users to enter all their workouts and then the application would generate a week's worth of a workout with each day dedicated to a different body part, Back Chest, Arms, and abs. At the time I had a very hard time deciding what to do when I went to the gym and I got bored of doing the same thing. So I came up with the idea of trying to disperse different kinds of exercises in the week with this application. 

To make this application I used mapping that would read the list of workouts the user makes by entering each of their workouts, here is the menu they are presented with:

And then here is a list that can be created that is organized by body part:

And finally here is the output of a weekly schedule of a workout:
